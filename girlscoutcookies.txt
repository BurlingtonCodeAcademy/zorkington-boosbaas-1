SECURITY GUARD sitting at DESK [telephone, pens, computer] asks GIRLSCOUT "What do you want?" 
GIRLSCOUT "do you want to buy some cookies?"
SECURITY GUARD Y/N if Y = "Of course" N = "You can't sell in here"

gets past SECURITY GUARD.

*goes into BUSINESS [ door, customers, employees, desk, ] can shout "anybody want cookies?" can find specific employee to ask, filling out form, collecting $$

*BUYER will buy - random generator for number of boxes
won't buy - give form in case change mind


*If DOOR is locked can slide a form under the door or tape it to the door


STAIRS -> status change, tired after climbing
ELEVATOR could get stuck


End conditions - time based? action based? 
winning = $$$ , so need [TOTAL] 
losing = if GIRLSCOUT picks up something or  BUSINESS3 says GIRLSCOUT looks like an undocumented alien calls ICE and locks her in a cage

DOOR locked Y/N, act of opening does it generate a sound?
